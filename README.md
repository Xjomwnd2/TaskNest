# Overview

TaskNest is a lightweight and intuitive task management web application designed to help users organize, track, and complete their daily tasks with ease. My goal in creating TaskNest was to sharpen my full-stack development skills by building a real-world, interactive web app that combines frontend design with backend functionality. This project allowed me to work with dynamic data rendering, form handling, and user interaction flows.

To run the app locally, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory in your terminal, and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build

# Once the server is running, open your browser and visit:

http://localhost:5173
to access the app.

# Purpose
The purpose of this software is to provide a simple, visually appealing, and responsive platform for users to create, edit, and manage tasks. It focuses on enhancing productivity through an organized interface.
